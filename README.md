# Algorithm and Data structure

- Clear defined problem statement with inputs/outputs
- Steps need to be in specific order
- Algorithm should be clearly defined,distinct, cannot be further broken down
- Should produce a result
- Should complete in a finite time and not loop infinitely

Need to ensure 'correctness' and 'efficiency'.

Efficiency - helps solves problems faster and provide better user experience. How does an algorithm perform in the worst case scenario?  

Time complexity - How long to complete a job? 

Space complexity - How much memory does the algorithm take?

Running time of algorithm -  TBD

Order of growth:
* n - number of tries.
* Big O - notation to describe complexity
* Complexity is relative
* Measures in worst case scenario



Linear time
* Sub-linear/Logarithmic time
* Quadratic time - n^2 - O(n^2)
* Cubic Runtime - n^3
* Quasilinear - O(n log n) - sorting algorithms (e.g. merge  )

- Linear search 
  - doesn't matter if numbers are sorted
  - O(n)
  - linear time
- Binary search
  - numbers have to be sorted
  - O(log n)
  - logarithmic/sub-linear runtime

Factorial
- O(n!)
